# Is your birthday lucky?

A simple VanillaJS app that checks if you were born on a lucky date or not.

You input your birthdate and the system tells you if your birthdate is lucky.

Written in HTML, CSS, VanillaJS.

I have tweaked the logic a bit if (sum of the digits of birthdate) % lucky_number == 2, then the birthdate is lucky.
